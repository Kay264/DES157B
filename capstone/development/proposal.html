        <h1>Capstone Project Proposal</h1>

        <h2>Q1: What is your topic and who is the target audience?</h2>
        <p>A1: I want to create a narative/data visualization about an endangered species. I think I want to focus on the black rhino </p>
        <h2>Q2:Identify lenses we have discussed in class that your topic may relay on most.</h2>
        <p>A2:I want to focus on data visualization but also lean into dystopian narratives.</p>
        <h2>Q3: What are some of the features you imagine your project/product would include?</h2>
        <p>A3: I want to try using a scroll interface. The bckground would be illustrations that change with the scroll. 
            On top of the image you'd have data related to what is going on in the narrative: 
            the rhino population decreasing, the forests getting cut down, the rhinos ending up in captivity, etc.</p>
        <h2>Q4:Are there possible tangents, challenges, concerns, or vague ideas related to your ideas?</h2>
        <p>A4:I think this idea will be fun but if there is anything wrong with it, I think I would consider doing something like "the story of a T-shirt".
            I would explore how garments go from cradle to grave and then end with conversations about the massive trash heaps all over the planet.
