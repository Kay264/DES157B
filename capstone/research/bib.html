                            This site is focused on giving some overview information about black rhinos as well as links to other resources.
                            This is relevent as it can help me with some of the more general information about the black rhinos, 
                            corroberate some of the data about black rhinos, and act as a source for actionable items. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the overview information provided is useful, I will likely see it repeated in other sources. 
                            This site is special for it's resources such as "adopt a black rhino" and "support anti-poaching".

                            The IRF is an organization that has been around since the 90s and seem to be connected to a lot of other organizations so I believe they are credible.
                            It's clear that this organization is well connected and cares deeply for rhinos.

                            This site is simply data about the Black Rhino population displayed in a table, map, and chart. 
                            This data will be central to my plan to display how the rhino population dramatically decreased and then increased a little. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This site is quite simple and to the point but it is extensive in the data it is displaying (more than other sites on this issue).
                            I know for sure that I want to use data from the chart, I might also explore the data that is displayed in the map and the table.

                            This site gives some indepth information about the different aspects of the Black Rhino species. 
                            This information includes "social behavior & territory", "Physical characteristics", and how the species is "Under threat". 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This will help me a lot with my discussion about the black rhino's characteristics and history. 
                            Similar to the IRP, this site is an organization that has been aiding rhinos for 30 years so them seem credible.

                            This site give a good overview of the issue of species loss. 
                            I will likely site it's data as a bridge between the Black Rhino and the larger issues of species loss.

                            WWF is the "World Wide Fund for Nature" and has been known for being a hub for nature conservation since 1961. 
                            While I am siting specifically this overview page, I might also look into some of WWFs other resources about the Black Rhino and actionable items.

                          The World Economic Forum has a lot of credible data. In this page specifically, has a lot of charts about biodiversity. 
                          Some relate to humanities footprint, some are hopeful and show how biodiversity could increase.

                            I definently want to consider including data from here in my piece when I link biodiveristy loss to impacts on humanity. 
                            I might use the images and site them, create my own displays of the data, or just talk about the data.

                            This is the same site I used earlier but a separate article. 
                            This one focuses on biodiversity overall and includes a graph of the "Living Planet Index".

                        <p>
                           This site also has links to related biodiversity data. This data is categoried into "Living Planet Index", "Mannals", "Extinctions", and "Other articles on biodiversity". 
                            Of the sites linked I am particularly interested in "How much of the world's food Production is Dependent on Pollinators?" 
                            This site can help melink species loss to species food chains to pollinator species to produce that people consume.
