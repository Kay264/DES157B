                    talks about sleep thrpough illutration and data visualization. I really like the ways that it uses scrolling to transition between illustrations and data.
                    I also really love the purely illustration based intro that goes from the sky, zooms into a bedroom, and faded into content as we see someone sleeping.

                    <a href="http://species-in-pieces.com/#">In Pieces</a> is an interactive data visualization site that explores species degridation. 
                    It showcases 30 different species, including the sumatran rhino. I specifically enjoy how they illustrate the rhino and the way that they display the data.
