                    <h2>Feature #1: narative section</h2>
                    <h4>Feature Description</h4>
                        <p>
                           this section involves some scroll tech. 
                           An image will be fixed on the screen as you scroll up untill a point. 
                           At a seaprate point the image will stop and start to fade as you scroll.
                        </p>
                    <h4>Tech Required</h4>
                        <p>
                            I think I'll either be able to do this with some 157A scroll review or I'll use GSAP scroll library stuff.
                        </p>

                    <h4>Skill Assessment</h4>
                        <p>
                           I need to do a little research but I don't imagine it will be too crazy difficult. 
                           I'm feeling like I'm at a 6/10 right now and could get to an 8/10 in an hour or two.
                        </p>
                       
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>Feature #2: Rhino Facts section</h2>
                    <h4>Feature Description</h4>
                        <p>
                           This section is all scroll tech. 
                           Images will be fixed and the scroll will reveal text and/or change an image.
                        </p>
                    <h4>Tech Required</h4>
                        <p>
                            I think this will be a combo of scroll review and the GSAP library.
                        </p>

                    <h4>Skill Assessment</h4>
                        <p>
                           Need to research a bit but I feel good. Currently a 7/10.
                        </p>
                       
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>Feature #3: Rhino Population Section</h2>
                    <h4>Feature Description</h4>
                        <p>
                           This section is also scroll tech. 
                           Everything will be fixed for a while. 
                           The scroll will change the year and population numbers as well the number of rhinos. 
                           There is also some text that will be revealed after the years are scrolled through.
                        </p>
                    <h4>Tech Required</h4>
                        <p>
                            I'll probably need a json for the year and population. 
                            Again it'll mostly be scroll stuff. 
                        </p>

                    <h4>Skill Assessment</h4>
                        <p>
                           Same as before, need to research a bit but I feel good. Currently a 7/10.
                        </p>
                       
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>Feature #4: Rhino Food Web Section</h2>
                    <h4>Feature Description</h4>
                        <p>
                           This section isn't scroll based. 
                           For this the images will change scale based on the increase or decrease buttons. 
                           the change in scale will impact other images. 
                           If an image gets to a certain scale it's display a message about what happended and reset
                        </p>
                    <h4>Tech Required</h4>
                        <p>
                            For this I will need to have each image as an object in a json with a scale attribute and a message.
                            I imagine I would make the threshold for a message a scale of 2 for all of them and an increment of 0.1 for each increase/decrease.
                            I'd need a bunch of if statements to handle the dependencies.
                            Then I'd need to just have an overlay and a reset for the message threshold.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          This one makes me nervous so I'll tackle it first. I feel 4/10 about it. Gonna be a lot of trial and error.
                        </p>
                       
                </li>

                    <h2>Feature #5: Big Picture & Actions Section</h2>
                    <h4>Feature Description</h4>
                        <p>
                          This section will just be scroll text tech to aid in readability. 
                        </p>
                    <h4>Tech Required</h4>
                        <p>
                            I'll probabaly just use GSAP for this. 
                        </p>


                    <h4>Skill Assessment</h4>
                        <p>
                         I think this is the easiest section, just need to confirm the GSAP code. 8/10 vibes.
                        </p>
