                    This project is a look into the future through what has happened in the past.
                    We have the power to decide where our collective future is heading and this project is an effort to help us steer in the right direction.
                    As seen above, there are a lot of different current trends that we can predict upon. 
                    For my project I wanted to give the spotlight to an issue that doesn't get the attension it deserves, species loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project is for people who care about the future of our environement as well as the future of humanity. 
                    This can include young people, scholars, and enviornmental scientists but also just regular people who care about their impact and their future.
                    These things can not be separated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this project started off as speculations about the future, it turned into a project that highlights an extremely important global crisis. 
                    This project emphasizes the scale of this issue by going from a micro view to a macro view.
                    The project starts as an exploration of the story of a single endangered species, the black rhino, and develops into a look at the big picture impact of species loss.

            <div class="content">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        When exploreing my ideas I was tempted to talk about popular subjects such as AI and social media. 
                        While I still hope to explore those topics, I really wanted my project to be unique and give space to something that doesn't get enough attension. 
                        That's why I choose to talk about the black rhino, one of the 47,000 species that are currently endangered. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once I decided that I wanted to explore species loss, I realized that I wanted to make my project more down to earth. 
                        I choose the black rhino as the main subject.
                        From there I wanted to do two types of research for my project: research on the content and research on the design.
                    </p>
                </div>
                 <div>
                    <p>
                        My content research was divided in three: the black rhino's characteristics & history, biodiversity loss, and the impact of biodiversity loss on humanity. 
                        Structuring my research this way lead me to structure my project in the same way. 
                        Reading about how the rhino population plummeted because of the poaching that came out of imperialism made me want to emphasize the depth of that kind of loss.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my design research I wanted to explore <a href="http://species-in-pieces.com/#">how other people have tackled this issue</a> but I also wanted to explore <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/HEALTH-SLEEP/mopakyjmnpa/?ref=sidebar">designs that weren't about the same topic</a>. 
                        I was particularly inspired by the scroll design of the "journey into sleep" project.

                        Going into the development of this project I had a lot of ideas.
                        Sadly given the time frame, I had to scrap a few of my ideas so I could develope the narative in a more balanced way. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As my ideas had to get cut down to something more realistic I ended up deciding to use scroll animations for most of the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visually I composed my project with photos I edited to look like graphic paintings as well as my own illustrations.
                        I wanted the illustrations to be the main focus so I tried to keep the text simple.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the next iteration I would like to break up the text more and make it more visually digestable.
                        But for this first iteration of the project, I knew I wanted to focus on the images and the overall message.

                    <p>
                        In the beginning section of the project I used illustrations and edited photos with the scroll mechanic to create a dynamic illustrative introduction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the second section about the black rhinos I had an informational about the rhino's characteristics, a visual representation of the loss of the rhino population, and an interactive food web that crashes when there is too much or too little of a species. 
                        All of these used scroll mechanics in some way but the food web also used species fucnctions and json data to create the intractions. 
                    </p>
                    
                </div>

                    <p>
                        I think since most of the featrues involve the scroll it's easy to pick up on what to do for each section veru quicly. 
                        For the food web section  I made sure to add a note that you can interact with the buttons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These are the main interactions I included:

                        <li>scroll animated illustration</li>

                    When I was developing this project I had my designer friend take a look at it. She really liked the images and the interactions but thought the text needed to be broken down more. 
                    I definently agree with her, but because of time constraights I couldn't make those changes in this version.
                   
                </p>
                <p>
                    I cleaned up the text to make it more readble but in my next iteration I want to make the text work with the scroll animations.
                    When you scroll and images change or animations happen, the text should reflect that content and be introduced alongside the scrolling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Developing this project, I learned a lot about both the content of this project, the black rhino & biodiversity loss, as well as how to take advantage of development tools such as the GSAP scroll library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm most found of the structure of this project and the ideas behind it. I think with a bit more development, this project could be really incredible.
                    The most challenging part of this experience was having to simplify and cut back my ideas to fit in the time contraint. 
                    For better or worse I always have a lot of ideas for these types of projects.
